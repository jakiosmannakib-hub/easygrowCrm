// Project actions (§13.3). Built to the 5-step shape from features/_example/actions.ts:
// validate → authorize → withTx → writeAudit → notify, inside the PUL-111 `actionResult`
// boundary.
//
// Stage 1 is §13.3.1 `createProject` (manual) and §13.3.3 `updateProject`. Still to come:
// §13.3.4 `archiveProject` / `unarchiveProject` (Stage 2), §13.3.5 `deleteProject`, and
// §13.3.2 `createProjectFromTemplate` (PUL-506, the Start Project wizard).

 * snapshot, the §17.7 #2 fix that `getClientProjectUsage` already applies. Reading against the
 * global `db` from inside `withTx` would sit outside the transaction, and a client archived in
 * between would leave a live project pointing at it.
 *
 * NOT_FOUND rather than GATE for the archived case, deliberately: from the caller's point of
 * view there is no such selectable client. `activeClientsQuery` never offers an archived one,
 * so a payload naming one is a stale form or a hand-made request, not a user who needs telling

 * Timestamps come from the clock port rather than the column defaults, so `created_at`,

 * the same reason `createClient` does it.
 *
 * `status` is left to the column default (`'active'`, §11.2) rather than written explicitly:
 * the default IS the spec, and repeating it here would create a second place to change it.
 *
 * `deadline >= start_date` is not checked in code. The `deadline_after_start` CHECK constraint
 * (migration 0005) enforces it for every writer, including SQL run by hand, and a duplicate
 * app-side check would be a second source of truth that can drift.

 * (§12.4 step 5) — a rolled-back project must not announce itself.

 * §13.3.3 `updateProject` — MGR (`project.update`).
 *
 * The PUL-203 diff convention, as in `updateEmployee` and `updateClient`: the UPDATE and the
 * audit row carry only the fields that actually changed, and a submit that changes nothing
 * writes nothing — no UPDATE, no `updated_at` bump, no audit row. A real form posts the whole
 * row back, so without this every "Save" would manufacture an audit event.
 *
 * **Changing `deadline` does NOT recompute task due dates** (§13.3.3). Those dates were
 * materialized when the project was instantiated from its template; moving them is a per-task
 * edit. This is the one guard §13.3.3 names, and it is a guard against doing something — so it
 * shows up here as the deliberate absence of a cascade, not as a check.
 *
 * Changing `clientId` re-runs the live-client guard: a project may not be moved onto an
 * archived client any more than it may be created on one.
 *
 * No archived-project guard yet. §13.3.4 makes archived projects read-only everywhere, so once
 * `archiveProject` lands (Stage 2) this action must refuse a target whose `status='archived'`.
 * Today no action can set that status, so the guard would be unreachable — it arrives with the
 * action that makes it reachable.
 *
 * Notify: none (§13.3.3).
